Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by 
N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class 
b) Highest score and lowest score of class 
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency

def sum_of_list(l):
    sum = 0
    for i in l:
        if i == -999:
            continue
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
    


def find_highest(l):
    highest = -999
    for i in l:
        if i > highest:
            highest = i
    return highest

def find_lowest(l):
    lowest = 999
    for i in l:
        if i < lowest:
            if i == -999:
                continue
            lowest = i
    return lowest
def count_frequency(l, mark):
    count = 0
    for i in l:
        if i == mark:
            count = count + 1
    return count

def find_highest_frequency(marks):
    frequency = 0
    highest_frequency = 0
    for i in marks:
        count = count_frequency(marks, i)
        if count > frequency:
            highest_frequency = i
            frequency = count
    return highest_frequency

    marks = []
    for i in range(int(input("Total number of students: "))):
        mark = int(input(f"Score of student no {i+1} in FDS: "))
        marks.append(mark)

    print(f"Highest marks: {find_highest(marks)}")
    print(f"fLowest marks: {find_lowest(marks)}")
